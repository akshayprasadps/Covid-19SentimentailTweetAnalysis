### INTRODUCTION:

Social scientists and psychologists take interest in understanding how people express emotions and sentiments when dealing with catastrophic events such as natural disasters, political unrest, and terrorism. The COVID-19 pandemic is a catastrophic event that has raised a number of psychological issues such as depression given abrupt social changes and lack of employment. Advancements of deep learning-based language models have been promising for sentiment analysis with data from social networks such as Twitter. Given the situation with COVID-19 pandemic, different countries had different peaks where rise and fall of new cases affected lock-downs which directly affected the economy and employment. During the rise of COVID-19 cases with stricter lock-downs, people have been expressing their sentiments in social media. This can provide a deep understanding of human psychology during catastrophic events. In this paper, we present a framework that employs deep learning-based language models via long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks for sentiment analysis during the rise of novel COVID-19 cases in India. The framework features LSTM language model with a global vector embedding and state-of-art BERT language model. We review the sentiments expressed for selective months in 2020 which covers the major peak of novel cases in India. Our framework utilises multi-label sentiment classification where more than one sentiment can be expressed at once. Our results indicate that the majority of the tweets have been positive with high levels of optimism during the rise of the novel COVID-19 cases and the number of tweets significantly lowered towards the peak. We find that the optimistic, annoyed and joking tweets mostly dominate the monthly tweets with much lower portion of negative sentiments. The predictions generally indicate that although the majority have been optimistic, a significant group of population has been annoyed towards the way the pandemic was handled by the authorities.

#### SOLUTION:
* 
This study introduces an innovative approach employing advanced deep learning models for sentiment analysis amid the surge of COVID-19 infections. Focusing on India as a case study, including specific regions like Maharashtra and Delhi, we harnessed a COVID-19 dataset comprising 10,000 meticulously hand-labeled tweets to train our deep learning models. Our analysis unveiled a spectrum of sentiments, with a dominant presence of "optimistic," "annoyed," and "joking" tweets that collectively conveyed optimism, apprehension, and uncertainty during the escalating COVID-19 cases in India. Intriguingly, the volume of tweets notably diminished during the peak of new cases. Notably, "optimistic," "annoyed," and "joking" tweets took center stage on a monthly basis, overshadowing a limited number of negative sentiments. Remarkably, tweets labeled as "joking" were predominantly associated with either "optimistic" or "annoyed" sentiments, with a minority expressing "thankful" feelings. Among "annoyed" tweets, the prevailing sentiments intertwined "surprised" and "joking." These findings underscore a duality in public sentiment, wherein a majority lean toward optimism while a notable segment expresses discontent with the pandemic's management by authorities.


### Results :
The study utilizes a test dataset comprising over 150,000 tweets associated with COVID-19 from India between March and September 2020, further generating separate datasets for Maharashtra and Delhi, containing around 18,000 tweets each. Initial dataset visualization showcases key language model features like bi-grams, tri-grams, and monthly tweet distribution, presented in Fig 2 alongside the number of cases. Notably, the term "folded—hand," a social and religious symbol, and certain tri-grams like "backhand—index—pointing" are discussed. The predictions of COVID-19-related sentiments are then presented for India, Maharashtra, and Delhi datasets, employing LSTM and BERT models trained on the Senwave dataset. The distribution of sentiments predicted by these models is illustrated in Fig 5, where "optimistic," "annoyed," and "joking" sentiments are dominant, with BERT capturing more sentiments than LSTM. Throughout the time span, "optimistic" sentiment prevails, followed by "annoyed" and "joking." The tweet count mirrors the trend of COVID-19 cases, declining after July, possibly indicating a decrease in concern despite the second peak in cases. This trend might suggest a shift from fear and concern to other emotional states, like depression and anxiety, as the pandemic situation evolved.
*******************************************************************************************************************************


#### Observations :
*******************************************************************************************************************************
The observation drawn from the presented analysis is that during the examined period of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, sentiments expressed on Twitter were primarily dominated by "optimistic," "annoyed," and "joking" emotions. This sentiment distribution was consistent across different geographical regions within India, namely Maharashtra and Delhi. Furthermore, the sentiment trends appeared to align with the trajectory of COVID-19 cases, suggesting a correlation between the pandemic's progression and the emotional expressions in social media posts. However, as the number of tweets declined after the initial peak of cases, it could indicate a shift from concern and fear towards other emotions, potentially reflective of evolving psychological responses to the ongoing crisis.

### Conclusion and Future Direction :
*******************************************************************************************************************************
#### Learnings : 
In conclusion, our analysis of sentiment patterns during the rise of COVID-19 infections in India reveals a predominant expression of "optimistic," "annoyed," and "joking" sentiments on Twitter. This sentiment distribution is consistent across different regions, indicating a common emotional response to the pandemic. Moreover, the sentiment trends align with the progression of COVID-19 cases, suggesting a correlation between the pandemic's impact and the emotions conveyed in social media posts. The decline in the number of tweets after the initial peak of cases hints at evolving emotional responses as the crisis unfolds. Our study showcases the potential of deep learning models, including LSTM and BERT, to uncover valuable insights into public sentiment during catastrophic events like the COVID-19 pandemic. For future work, we propose extending this framework to different regions, populations, and scenarios, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of how sentiments evolve across diverse contexts. Additionally, incorporating topic modeling with sentiment analysis could provide deeper insights into emerging themes and concerns during such events, enhancing our understanding of the psychological and emotional dimensions of large-scale disruptions.

#### Results Discussion :

The examination of sentiments expressed through different modes of communication reveals varying capabilities in conveying multiple emotions simultaneously. While facial expressions offer limited variations, spoken or written emotions, such as those found in tweets, demonstrate a more nuanced ability to express multiple sentiments concurrently. This observation, depicted in our analysis (Fig 9), highlights that a majority of tweets, both hand-labelled and predicted, predominantly convey a single sentiment, followed by instances of two sentiments being expressed, with a minority featuring three. Notably, tweets devoid of distinct sentiments are prevalent, while those expressing more than three emotions are absent. This intriguing aspect of emotion expression has not been extensively studied in relation to rapidly evolving catastrophic events like the surge in COVID-19 cases.

Shifting focus to the specific Indian dataset (Fig 10), an intriguing trend emerges. Unlike the direct correspondence between the surge in the number of tweets and novel COVID-19 cases, the rise in monthly tweets exhibits a more gradual pattern, reaching its peak around July. Intriguingly, a significant reduction in the number of tweets occurs just a month before India's peak in novel cases. The dominant sentiments across different months in India, Maharashtra, and Delhi (Figs 10–12) underscore the prevalence of "optimistic," "annoyed," and "joking" emotions, with fewer instances of negative sentiments. However, this framework has inherent limitations. While the training data, carefully annotated by experts, encompasses global tweets, it might not adequately capture region-specific nuances of humor expression. Additionally, the dataset represents only a fraction of the population, potentially introducing biases. Furthermore, cultural and linguistic diversity in India adds complexity to context interpretation. The uncertainties inherent in model predictions, arising from challenges in quantifying uncertainties in model parameters and data, offer avenues for future research, including the exploration of Bayesian deep learning to address these uncertainties.
*******************************************************************************************************************************
#### Limitations :

Cultural and Regional Nuances: The framework may not fully account for cultural and regional variations in sentiment expression, particularly in humor. Humor is culturally nuanced and can be expressed differently across regions, potentially leading to misinterpretation or inaccurate sentiment categorization.

Sampling Bias: The analysis is based on data from social media platforms, which may not represent a diverse range of viewpoints due to inherent biases in user demographics and limitations in free expression caused by political and social factors. This can result in an incomplete understanding of the sentiment landscape.

Diversity of Expression: The linguistic and cultural diversity within India presents challenges in accurately converting multilingual content into English while preserving context. Certain cultural or regional context might be lost in translation, impacting the accuracy of sentiment analysis.

Training Data Misalignment: The training data used for model development was sourced from worldwide tweets, which may not fully capture the unique sentiment expression patterns of the Indian population. The nuances of sentiment expression in India could differ significantly from the global dataset, potentially affecting the model's accuracy.

Uncertainties in Prediction: The hand-labelled training dataset, which includes tweets expressing multiple sentiments, introduces uncertainties in model predictions. The subjective nature of sentiment interpretation and the brevity of tweets make it challenging to precisely categorize multi-sentiment content.

Bayesian Deep Learning and Uncertainty: The study does not fully address uncertainties associated with model parameters and data interpretation. Bayesian deep learning could offer a more robust approach to quantifying and addressing uncertainties in sentiment predictions.
